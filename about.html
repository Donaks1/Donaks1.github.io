                ABOUT ME
            </h1>
            <p>
                Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
                proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
                you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t
                hold with such nonsense.
                Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
                made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
                and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which
                came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over
                garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small
                son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
                The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a
                secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
